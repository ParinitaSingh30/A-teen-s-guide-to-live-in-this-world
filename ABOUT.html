  <h1> About this Webpage </h1>

  <p> Hi! So,
    if you think that this website is an information provider, or that the information on this website is 100% true or something, its not. </p>

    <p> If you think that I am/ this website is made by some serious big responsible authorities like school, parents or teenage welfare association something like that, this webpage, is definately not about that. </p>

    <p> These are just random 3 a.m. thoughts of a 16-year old that has helped her get through a lot of stuff, and made this webpage because she thinks it could help a lot of other teenagers too. </p>

    <p> And in rule 4, where I told you about Drug prevention and alocohol addiction, you can learn more about it here: </p>
