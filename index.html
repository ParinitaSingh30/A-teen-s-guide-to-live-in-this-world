      <h2> Rule 1: Don’t be scared to dream (it’s free) </h2>
      <div class="aligned">
      <img src="assets/quote 2.png" alt="Dream big and dare to fail">
      <span>Dreaming, it is the only thing that is truly ours, with none of society’s myths and taboos, parent’s rules and regulations. You can dream whenever you want, wherever you want, with whoever you want. Then why not dream? I know that you are afraid that if you won’t be able to achieve it your heart would break, and that’s why you don’t dream from the beginning.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="aligned">
      <img src="assets/quote 3.png" alt="What if I fall? But my darling, what if u fly?">
      <span> Not dreaming just because you are scared to fail, is a bad reason. But dreaming because you can’t wait for the day when you are able to say “I made it”. And don’t you dare be scared to dream big, don’t you dare stop dreaming. </span>
      <img src="assets/quote 4.png" alt="If your dreams dont scare you, they are too small.">
      </div>  
     

       <h2> Rule 2: Always di– Wait a minute, why are you still here?</h2>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 5.png" alt="Stop wishing, start doing">
       <span> Your dream wouldn’t just go and achieve itself. It’s you who has to achieve it, because it’s you who has dreamt of it. And trust me you can. If you have been waiting for a sign, this is it. Get up, and get going. </span>
       </div>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 6.png" alt="Try a little harder, to be a little batter">
       <span> I know it’s not easy, and I know it is a lot harder than just dreaming. But whenever you even think of giving up, just remember of your young self, would they be proud of you? Would they look up to you and want to be you when they grow up? I don’t think so. But you can now, work hard now so that you can be proud of who you will be in future. And whenever you will think of your present self in future, I am sure they would be proud of you. </span>
       <img src="assets/quote 7.png" alt="Be who you needed when you were younger">
       </div>

       <h2> Rule 3: Enjoy your life, take risks </h2>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 8.png" alt="If no one comes from the future to stop you from doing it, then how bad of a decision can it really be?">
       <span> “Look at you. You’re young. And you’re scared. Why are you scared? Stop being paralyzed. Stop swallowing your words. Stop caring what other people think. Wear what you want. Listen to the music you want to listen to. Play it as loud as you want to and dance to it, Go out for a drive at midnight and forget that you have school next day. Stop waiting for Friday. Live now. Do it now. Take risks. This life is yours. When are you going to realize that you can do whatever you want?” – Louise Flory </span>
       </div>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 9.png" alt="No risk, No story.">
       <span> Stop living on other people’s experiences and get satisfied from their stories, Make your own experiences, your own stories, you don’t want to tell your children what your father or the boy from that book or that girl from the movie did. You want to tell them what you did,the mistakes you made and what you learnt from them and relive those moments while you narrate them. You need to take risks now. Make experiences now. “When was the last time you did something for the first time”? “You make your life hard by always being in your head. Life is simple, get out of your head and get into the moment” – s.mcnutt. Don’t hesitate to take risks, Don’t ever have regrets in your life. </span>

       <h2> Rule 4: Know where the fun ends, and danger begins </h2>
       <div class="aligned"> 
       <img src="assets/quote 11.png" alt="Drugs + y>our bady = it isn't pretty">
       <span> I agree that there are no limits of having fun, but you should know when to stop, where you should be aware of the difference between enjoying and destroying your life and future. Excess of anything is harmful. So learn when to stop. </span>
       <img src="assets/quote 12.jpg" alt="The goal is not to be sober, the goal is to love yourself so much that you dont need to consume alcohol or drugs">
       </div>

       <h2> Rule 5: Society’s weird. But so are you. </h2>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 13.png" alt="If it makes you happy, ">
       <span> In a society You will get various types of people, some will say “Don’t do it, believe me, I’ve been there done that” others will say “That’s not how you do it, follow the rules and you will succeed as everyone before you did” and some will even say “You’re weird, I don’t know why that makes you happy” and there is not a lack of people who say “That’s not how you dress. What will people say?  That’s not who you should be friends with. That’s not what we taught you. Is that really who you want to be in your future like”. </span>
       </div>
       <div class="aligned">
       <span> You were born different. Everyone is. But it is not everyone who stays who they are and not get influenced by society’s expectations, rules and regulations or myths and taboos. Be weird. Be different. Be you. </span>
       <img src="assets/quote 14.jpeg" alt="Don't let the muggles get you down">
       </div>
       <div class="aligned">
       <img src="assets/quote 15.png" alt="No one is you and that is your power">
       <span> Don’t change your dreams or goals or even your plans just because the society won’t agree. Don’t try to be like everyone else. Don’t try so hard to fit in, Don’t ever lay low, stand tall and roar like a lion on their faces. Don’t follow the trend blindly. Be who you are so that one day, a child can say “I want to be like them when I grow up”, and the society doesn’t call him weird. </span>
       <img src="assets/quote 16.png" alt="Kill them with success and bury them with a smile">
       </div>

       <h2> Rule- Not exactly a rule. </h2>
       <h2> Parents... </h2>
       <div class="aligned">
       <span> Finally, we have reached to the part where we talk about people we love the most in the world, even after times they give us reasons to not. So, at this topic, honestly, even I don’t have anything to say, but I will tell you what I surely know. They are the only people who genuinely care about us, the only people in the world, who will accept you for who you are even after countless mistakes you may have done. Sometimes, you may think that they are wrong, and they might be, but never speak with them disrespectfully, instead you can kindly take their words in consideration. I said this because when you were younger, and you were doing addition, and you wouldn’t understand what 5+6 is, they would have scolded you, hit you, and even explained it to you calmly, but never left you on your own alone. The same way, do not hide who you really are from your parents, they might be upset, but will never abandon you. They will always be happy for your successes and will always be proud of who you are. So, let’s give our parents a little something in return for everything that they have done for us, let’s make our parents proud. </span>
